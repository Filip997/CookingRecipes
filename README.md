# CookingRecipes
CookingRecipes is a basic app that makes API calls from https://food2fork.ca/?fbclid=IwAR0BYFzc_agcnUF33f6fsIslRWQmx67ycJcQVEjfEf0RgMyfs_8nnoS6uk4#Search-Recipes and
stores the data(recipes) that gets it from there in a Room database. So basically it works while there's an internet connection, or while there's no internet connection if
the database has some data in it.
